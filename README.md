# RedditDownloader
A simple CLI tool to download reddit text posts and comments. 

### Prerequisites
For this to work, you will need to have [PRAW](https://pypi.org/project/praw/) (The Python Reddit API Wrapper) and [prawcore](https://pypi.org/project/prawcore/) (a communication layer used by PRAW) downloaded.These can be downloaded individually using [PIP](https://pypi.org/).

If you have PIP already downloaded, you can use the simple command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
###Usage
As of now, the only way to use RedditDownloader is by running [redditdownloader.py](https://github.com/argonautica/redditdownloader/blob/master/redditdownloader.py).
