gua4x0,"College freshman going on sophomore here. I have one piece of advice for this sub. Do the research and then do ED to a school you will truly fit into. Rankings are a lie. Every school has smart people. You will find happiness by choosing a school, not letting the school choose you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gua4x0/college_freshman_going_on_sophomore_here_i_have/,scrublinux,10,2020-05-31 17:11:19,8,/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gua4x0/college_freshman_going_on_sophomore_here_i_have/,Rant,"[""I think it's great that you love where you're at, but I think you have to realize that other people have a very different mindset. \n\nWe're high schoolers. We change easily. I don't think EDing to one school is a good idea unless you're 100% in love with a school and know you'll never change your mind. \n\nI also agree that prestige shouldn't determine your college choice, but it's also part of what makes up a community, no?"", ""Appreciate the fine response! \n\nJust wanted to clarify, I said the 3 prerequisites for ED are 1) confirming you can afford it, 2) doing holistic research to confirm you like the school, and 3) can reasonably expect to get into. \n\nAffordability is obviously super important. Luckily, with most schools this is something you can calculate before applying (excluding merit aid). Also, ED is not financially binding, you can drop it for financial reasons. You will never end up getting into a school ED and feeling forced to pay more money than you counted on. \n\nMaking sure the school has room for you to explore lots of potential interests is a part of number 2. If you find yourself in a position like you described with the MIT example, you didn't do enough research in the first place. \n\nThe last one is UBER important. I think most of this sub does not realize that the competitiveness of a college reflects the level of academic work you're going to be doing at the school. It also reflects the attitude of the people you'll be going to school with. Brown is a top school with kickass academics and insanely competitive admissions. Therefore, if you go to brown, you can reasonably expect to be surrounded by people who are academically kick-ass and have the chops to make it through the insanely competitive admissions just like you did. Maybe that's your thing! If so, good for you. It's just a huge thing people often forget to consider when thinking about schools. \n\nAnyway, you have a great day too!"", 'oof i definitely do not agree with this for a few reasons. \n\nThe first reason that if you ED a school you can definitely afford you might be missing out on big aid from other schools you enjoy just as much or maybe more. obviously don‚Äôt base your list off of rankings alone, but imo keep your options open. especially if you‚Äôre able to appeal your financial aid with another schools offer. Maybe that‚Äôs the ‚Äòweird middle class not rich enough to pay for school but not in need enough to receive aid‚Äô in me talking but yeah. \n\nAlso what if you change your mind? You ED in the first semester of your senior year to MIT and you get in. Great! The second semester of your senior year you take a marketing elective and oh shoot- you love it. you want to explore it more. But there‚Äôs now no business program (i don‚Äôt think MIT has business i don‚Äôt actually know this is just an example). You commit to neuroscience then find a passion for biomedical engineering when you on a spur join robotics. You commit to a STEM school and then suddenly take a creative writing elective and realize there‚Äôs no minor or double major you can take. Things change. \n\nLet‚Äôs say I know i‚Äôll get into UMass Amherst. I‚Äôm positive. But I really want to go to Brown (not for prestige, not for rankings, because I like their location and open curriculum). I can afford it, I‚Äôm just not sure I‚Äôll get in. I apply ED to Umass (I know they don‚Äôt have an ED program but I‚Äôm too tired to find a school that does so just for arguments sake) and congrats! I‚Äôm in. Then I get a huge full ride scholarship. Wow. So could I have gotten into Brown? Should I have decided not to ED it just because I‚Äôm not positive about getting in?\n\nOn the flip side\n\nLet‚Äôs say I ED Brown and get in. Great! I can afford it, but barely. I have to take out loans. I‚Äôll be in debt after I graduate. It‚Äôs not horrible debt, but it‚Äôll take awhile to pay off. What if I had applied to Northeastern and gotten a full ride? It‚Äôs a great school, and then I‚Äôd graduate with no debt. **Just because you ‚Äòcan‚Äô afford it doesn‚Äôt mean you ‚Äòshould‚Äô pay for it. in any school scenario.**\n\nOr I can completely play it safe and apply ED to my state school without all the programs I want, (i.e. I want to learn russian and they don‚Äôt offer languages besides the romance languages and chinese) because that is the **only** place i know i can both get into academically and afford in its entirety. Even if I learn to love it, other schools would‚Äôve been a better fit in the end. \n\n(I‚Äôm not saying any of those examples are me I‚Äôm not smart enough to ED brown/MIT lol those are just popular schools to get the point across)\n\nI‚Äôm really really glad this method worked out for you, and I wish it worked for everyone, but it‚Äôs just not realistic to tell people to forget every other method they‚Äôve heard and definitely do this. If everyone did this nobody would reach for schools like Brown anymore. I, personally, absolutely adore Brown for it‚Äôs open curriculum and proximity to Boston. Does that mean I‚Äôd pay full tuition to go there? Nope I‚Äôd rather go to my state school debt free. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I should completely forget about it and assume I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it. Maybe they‚Äôll surprise me financially. Maybe I‚Äôll get into a liberal arts school with great financial aid and I can go there or appeal Brown. I can‚Äôt ‚Äòafford‚Äô to play it safe both financially and academically. I, and many students like me, have to keep our options open. \n\nOberlin sounds like a great school and I hope you have an amazing time! I hope I don‚Äôt come across as argumentative, I just wanted to show you the flip side of the coin, as someone who doesn‚Äôt care about rankings or prestige. This also may not be a super cohesive argument because it‚Äôs late here and my minds all over the place, but I hope I get my point across. \n\nTo quote u/eccentricgalaxy , Have a nice day!', 'As someone who did exactly this, trust me: once you\'re a year into college (and you actually picked the right college for you) you\'ll stop caring about the perceived prestige of whatever school you go to. If you\'re still riding on the ""I like this school cuz other people think it\'s good"" idea by that point, you picked the wrong school. \n\nYou\'re a rising senior so you might actually realize this as soon as next year. Loads of smart people get rejected from ""hard"" schools and people you never suspected will get into ivies. You loving the school you go to is worth so much more than others thinking highly of it.', 'Tbh I don\'t think EDing to a school that you\'re likely to get into is a good idea for everyone. If I got into an ""easy"" school early decision, even if it was my top choice, I would have regrets and wonder if I could have gotten into the schools that are ranked higher. This shouldn\'t be a problem for people that don\'t care about prestige but unfortunately I do.', 'the thing you need to love to ED is the community. The other aspects of the school are definitely a learn-to-love-it situation. I have never known a person that didn\'t like their ED school, and many people do apply to ED schools just because of the community. \n\nKeep in mind, there\'s also learn-to-hate-it. If you go to a school that you don\'t really love that much but have convinced yourself to like because other people or rankings told you so, you might end up not having a nice time. I have some  friends that this happened to. \n\nTrust me when I say the ""best school"" you can get into is not necessarily the best school for you.', 'I mean I agree with you on the part about EDing where you have a decent chance to get in to have a much better senior year, but I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúkinda liking‚Äù the school is enough. You need to love it to ED.']"

Espionage and some other shit. That's why they scared."", ""My biggest issue with the og poster of this thread was the expectation of protests specifically for covid related asian discrimination. Asians have every right (and should) to continue to fight against the issues they face in America - wanting the same response as the current BLM movements happening for (specifically) covid related asian discrimination doesn't make sense because it takes the entire context of BLM out. What's happening now is not just about GF, or situation based racism. It's systemic. I wouldn't have an issue if they wanted protests for all the racism asians face in America, bc that's a lot more than just covid.\n\nI 100% agree with what you said (I would like more sources for the largest economic disparity within a racial group - I would like to read more about this). No  one chooses to be the white person's model minority - I understand and respect that, my perspective just came from the fact that there just happens to be many asians who buy into that and benefit from it. Lots of asians also happen to be quite racist to black people (not all, but many. this issue has been self identified as well). I will read more about The Yellow and Black Panthers and other similar organizations of poc solidarity. I would like to learn more about that lynching and overall enslavement of asians in america (this was pre 1960's yes? Asians were treated horrendously in the first half of the 1900s here. Were asians here before the 1900s? I think there's a lot of reading I need to do) I think in my posts I mainly focused on 1970s and on when the majority of the current asian population immigrated here. I do know they had education standards and requirements to come here, so that may have contributed to the model minority mindset. I do apologize for the blanket statements, I did use general statements when addressing asian struggles versus black struggles, and that's not a fair comparison. \n\nI would like to end on how you mentioned a divide between wealthy asians and the large population of undocumented immigrants (and immigrants overall) who make up a large part of the asian community. Do you think the struggles they face are because they're asian or because they're immigrants and/or poor? Are the struggles they face uniquely because of their race or is it more based in their socioeconomic status (is this status for them caused by being asian?) or experience as an immigrant? Can you highlight some of the systemic barriers? What I'm trying to question ultimately is how much of these struggles are predetermined by race rather than situation, because some of those struggles are faced by immigrants and low/middle class people regardless of race. Is the asian-ness what's causing them to be in this situation?\n\nAlso, I am not asian, I am black (an immigrant to America though, so that puts me in a different perspective ig.) I was hesitant to make those posts bc I don't want to detract from the point of this discussion, which is specifically for Asian related struggles. The comparison with the current protests and covid discrimination just really irked me. I definitely have had the privilege to not learn about the deep rooted racism and injustices of your community, so please do educate me on them."", ""It's because Asians are successful."", 'Asians were enslaved, and they were murdered and lynched. In fact one of the largest lynchings in history were towards Asians.\n\nYou just don‚Äôt know this because white institutions have covered this up. \n\nThere has been silence in our community, but it‚Äôs unfair to say asian ppl have been silent this whole time while blacks have supported us. Historically, Asians have supported blacks too. Asians4blacklives, the yellow and black panthers, yellow peril for black power, even MLK worked with Asian activists. There are hundreds of more examples. \n\nThe reason why you never hear of this either is again because of those same white institutions. \n\nYou have to realize we didn‚Äôt choose to be a model minority, that myth was placed on us by whites. And for millions in our group it‚Äôs an outright lie and it actually actively hurts them. Today, There are millions of undocumented immigrants in our community, there are working class, ppl who‚Äôs faced systematic barriers, chinese racially prosecuted by the FBI, the list goes on. Some places we have the highest poverty rates of any race. \n\nWe have the largest economic disparities within any racial group. So yes there are those who are privileged in the Asian community but when you make those blanket statements about Asians not experiencing this or should be doing this, realize that you‚Äôre undermining a huge part of the population. And contributing to the model minority myth that these whites love to employ.  Rich Asians often love projecting their own privilege over the entire Asian community, and undermine those who are far less privileged within their community.  \n\nI understand your message has good intentions but you need to realize that you may be one of those Rich Asians contributing to the problem if you have had the privilege to ignore the deep rooted racist history and the hundreds of current injustices those within our community faces.  Bc it srsly seems like you think that Covid 19 racism is the worse that Asians have ever experienced', '^^^^^ THIS!!!', ""Ahh yeah, I can empathize with that feeling.

My post might've been a bit misleading, but I do hope that people can separate anti-CCP vs racism, like you said (and hopefully the actions of the CCP vs beliefs of Chinese individuals as well).\n\nAnd I agree, it's a relief to have a civil conversation :)"", 'You can make claims, but they are without merit or support. What is factual is it has been PROVEN that Chinese students who study abroad have given research unlawfully to the Chinese govt., which is essentially stealing. Therefore, there was a need to limit (not ban) the amount of Chinese students entering to study here in the U.S. It seems like your own bias has denigrated you to saying everythihg and everyone is ignorant. I‚Äôve said it before, if one is pro-democracy, pro-human rights, or anti-totalitarian, it does not equate to being anti-China, sinophobia, or racism. They are not mutually exclusive. In this case, a stance against intellectual property theft is not embedded in ignorance when it has been proven that sensitive research have been stolen from said students. It is an appropriate response and you can make all the hyperbolic claims out of thin air if you want.']"

About 1/3 people in the research dept. at my local Fed are from Chicago, they place the strongest for RA roles too, from what I saw there.)\n3.

Excellent placement after graduation of course)\n4. Duke (apparently according to US News.

Nothing too flashy from what I've seen, but can't go wrong with being at an Ivy. The other Ivys have decent programs, I think it generally beats out state school ones just because of the name, but if cost is a factor, they aren't super well known for econ, so going to a top state school is fine. Maybe it will benefit for grad-school, probably not too much though. Only real benefit I see if more opportunity for research and working with profs.)\n11. Any top public school with an undergrad business school.\n\nNo idea where Stanford ranks in this, never heard of their econ dept, but I'm on the east coast, so...\n\nNot sure where to rank these, but Wisconsin and URochester also place very well at the Fed specifically.

In California, UCLA and Berkeley are some of the top schools in the nation and definitely give privates a run for their money, but can ask for $70k a year easily.  For me personally, I got in for Georgia Tech for engineering (lovely school), but I decided against the $50k price tag as a FL resident. If you are able to pay full tuition as an out of state resident comfortably every year, I think it's worth applying to any public you like.  If not, I don't think it should be a strong deterrent (go apply still) but I wouldn't be shocked if the financials are bad.  If she's looking at private schools like Vanderbilt all the way to Yale or Brown (typically top 20 schools that carry prestige) they do offer good aid for accepted students.  My thoughts are that you should apply to any college you want and then eliminate colleges after the financial aid packages come out.  \n\nIf the online classes don't offer APs or honors, I wouldn't recommend it.  An admissions officer at a selective college may ask why the student didn't take the most rigorous classes (typically APs) offered to her at her school, and might be a strong reason as to why the student is not accepted.   If she has any thoughts of applying out of state to Cali, I would try to keep all doors open and maximize her chances by taking the most rigorous schedule she can.  \n\nI think volunteer and non-school sports leagues are great activities, but as someone who went through the college application process, they are pretty run of the mill for most students.  If she's looking a selective out of state schools (especially any UCs), I would recommend getting very involved in student clubs at school and getting a few leadership positions.  If you don't, I would have to say that the rest of the application has to be pretty stellar (one of kind, world class) in order to be accepted.  \n\nIf your daughter really really wants to do online schooling, it won't tank her chances in-state, but do understand that it might be difficult to be the strongest applicant at colleges with below 50% acceptance rates."", ""Thanks so much for the extensive info. I do not know what type of school she is looking at just yet. State level school would be my guess, but she's talking about out of state schools so I am not sure how that would play out. If she went to a California state school but we live in Ohio. Is that harder to get in? I did tell her it would look better taking honors or AP courses in her regular school than taking online classes. That make sense?\n\nThe more info I get the less info I think her and her mother got about this. I'm trying to prevent her having an issue down the road where she can't get in places she might have if she stayed in regular school. Or to prevent a hard transition to college classes from online high school. \n\nShe says she will do volunteer work and non-school sports leagues and that sort of thing but it doesn't seem the same as being a part of school sports or clubs. She can do the volunteer work either way.\n\nThanks again for the valuable info. I appreciate it!"", ""FLVS [link here](https://www.flvs.net) is an online platform used primarily by Florida students for online schooling.  However, out of state students can use it as well, but I think you might have to pay for it (discuss with your school).  You can browse the course catalog and they have a very wide selection of offerings - the primary attractor for me, as I got to learn things I wouldn't have been able to get at my own public school. \n\nCertain assignments and readings contained fluff and requirements that honestly felt like they were asking more than was required to retain the knowledge.  I would say that it's variable to the class you're taking - APs were properly challenging but the readings in the lesson were not as helpful as a prep book.  Grades will be easier to maintain higher. If you want an A, you can get it, but it will require work for sure.  FLVS will not hand out A's like candy.  Some teachers will grade pretty leniently, but others are pretty stringent. \n\nIn terms of rigor, AP classes are probably as rigorous as you can get.  I would recommend APs if you want the rigor as it essentially is equivalent to a general-ed class at the college level.   For the most part, I will say that it's not as difficult as a your traditional setting, but it doesn't slack off too significantly.  This is exclusive to FLVS though, and if you plan on using a different platform I would read into the reviews as  all online programs are not made the same. \n\nCollege-wise, I will agree that it probably won't look as good as a public school education. What type of colleges does your child plan on going for?  If she is looking at top tier institutions (Harvard to Vanderbilt to duke) she will miss out on extracurriculars in a traditional school setting that are needed for a successful application.  For my state flagship (UF or even FSU), the acceptance rate was below 50% and successful students typically had their resumes padded with strong extracurriculars and school involvement.  If you want to go to a school that has an acceptance rate hovering below 50%, I would talk with other people and the counselor to understand what a successful applicant looks like. Very rarely do students with no extra-curricular involvement land spots at the state flagship institution, and if you want to keep your doors open, I would take that into consideration.  A few students I know did their AA at the local college for grades 11 through 12, but were typically isolated to themselves and were cutoff from the rest of our school in terms of social life. If she plans on going to school to attend the clubs in the afternoon or getting involved somehow with the college I would say that it's fine.  However, the absence of any extracurriculars will likely get you rejected at the top schools in your state. \n\nI think most kids thrive off of structure in a traditional classroom setting.  I don't think the benefits of online schooling are significantly better than a traditional classroom.  I would like to reiterate that this is just my experience with FLVS, and that it is not the account of others on FLVS or representative of online schooling as a whole."", ""Thanks for pointing that out! Yes, I agree that FLVS works for a certain type of student.  I really loved the idea of being able to work ahead, however that can lead to a cycle of crash-completing multiple assignments in one night if you haven't had the time to do it during the week to meet the weekly goal.  In my experience our school uses a few classes like HOPE ( essentially a PE class) and US History as fill-ins if kids couldn't take it at school.  The amount of cheating going on - lying and googling was apparent enough to be a problem from what I witnessed at my school.  However, I recognize that this is just my account and it is on your own motivation to get things done and learn things honestly.  I do think that TurnItIn and *especially* DBAs are very effective at measuring if the student learned anything, but rampant cheating can still occur on the online tests.   All in all, I think it's up to the student to decide how they want to approach this learning opportunity.  \n\nI've taken probably 5 classes on there from the above two I previously mentioned and a few APs.  I do think that I was properly challenged in my AP classes, but I can't help feeling that maybe I would have been better off with getting a Barron's subject book and flipping through that than reading the lessons.  There were times where I felt like the lessons were absolutely unhelpful and it lead to me scouring Youtube to learn things.  Certain classes like US History and Anatomy &amp; Physiology contained tedious assignments that I did not enjoy doing and some of the assignment requirements asked for more than what was needed. However, this is just my personal preference and experience. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think it's up the student to see how seriously they take it.  Some people will take advantage of the system, but I agree that it shouldn't detract from the benefits of FLVS as well."", ""She has been very good with the recent work at home COVID stuff, but my main concern isn't really her doing the work. It's that the work itself will be easier plus the appearance of online schooling when applying for college does not look as good. The assumption is most will cheat at some point because you easily can.\n\nMy big fear is what you say about the fluff and 70% of assignments being BS. The grades (even if better than hers are now) are meaningless if the perception (real or not) is that the work you're doing is easier. And I keep hearing that it is not as in-depth or as difficult.\n\nShe's having issues, but not to the point I feel that she needs to be pulled from school. This was her idea and not I am pushing back on her and mom (my ex, who conveniently already told her she doesn't see a problem with it). I'll be the bad guy if need be because that's my job, but I don't want to push back just to do it. I want to make sure I make an educated decision. I have not seen a good reason yet to have her do online schooling. The advantages are that she doesn't deal with social situations.\n\nWhat is FLVS?\n\nTHANK YOU!"", ""That's a big concern. She seems motivated to do her work, but I just do not see online having the same depth of knowledge as regular school would. It's just completing assignments."", ""I'm going to talk to her more, but I am sure it's mostly social since she doesn't make or keep friends well. She trying to sell my on the idea saying it will help her for college and her grades will be better and she will have more time for a job and activities, but her regular school gets out at 2:15pm. She has plenty of time for all that and I cannot see any college seeing online schooling as a good thing compared to regular school. Maybe I'm wrong.\n\nI fear that her social skills will deteriorate even more if she's allowed to isolate and just do her stuff at home which will make college that much more difficult."", 'As a long-time FLVS-FT student, I actually have to disagree with some of your points. I used to be a public school student but switched to flvs because I was always working ahead and felt like I wasn‚Äôt learning enough.\n\nYes, there is a *small* percentage (from what I‚Äôve noticed) of students who slack off on their assignments and cheat, but it‚Äôs disheartening to see flvs get stereotyped as a platform composed of mostly cheaters when I know many students who work incredibly hard in their academics.\n\nOver the last few years, the platform (flvs) has implemented multiple regulations that help to prevent cheating, such as TurnItIn, and written assignments along with DBAs (discussion based assessments) make sure that the student learns and understands the material well.\n\nIn my personal experience, the course material is challenging, but rewarding, and the instructors are amazing! Even though I had my doubts about online school before I started, it was the best decision I had ever made in regards to academics and I am now graduating a year earlier in good standing because of it!\n\n(Going back to the poster) If your daughter wishes to do online school, I would definitely recommend it, however, have your daughter carefully evaluate how her year would look. Online school takes a lot more dedication and responsibility as students (typically) have to create their own schedule and follow it. If you put the work into it and don‚Äôt slack off, it can be a rewarding experience, but a student may struggle if they don‚Äôt take it as seriously as regular/public school.', ""Online high school is horrible. Without any academic accountability (something that teenagers definitely need), learning doesn't happen."", ""I took online classes (out of interest to learn new subjects as a supplement to my public school education)  and I can say that most kids will procrastinate on their assignments. It takes a lot of motivation to not only complete the material, bit to also actually *learn* it. I can say that 90% of kids will cheat on the stuff, and if the platform they use is very established (like FLVS), previous students will post answers online. If everything can be googled, not a lot will be retained.  Also, the way in which the material was taught contained a lot of fluff and 70% of the assignments were bs.  I would like to preference that this is just my experience with flvs online schooling, and it is not representative of everyone.  \n\n\nI don't recommend doing online school at all, unless there are huge social issues or your child thrives on their own proactive motivation to get things done. I would assess how your child balanced the recent changes to online schooling as a baseline.""]"

I\'d rather go to Pomona or Swarthmore than Berkeley if I wanted to do a PhD in physics.\n\nDisclaimer: I do go to Brown, so that\'s the only school I\'m qualified to talk about for undergrad (besides some experience at Berkeley).', 'Yes, Yale has that advantage too, as does Princeton.  They also have history going back to the beginning of the Rhodes scholarship program, when the overwhelming majority of the Rhodes scholarships went to students at HYP.  \n\n3 of the 7 Nobelists associated with Brown were people who were visiting scholars for one semester or year.  Sometimes schools count them too, and that is fine.  Of course, if you do that, Yale has over 60.\n\nFinally, I totally agree with you on focusing on the undergraduate experience, class sizes, and the opportunities available on average to a typical student who goes there.  Amherst and Williams would be in my top10 list, and some of the schools that get the most hype on a2c are totally overrated with regard to undergraduate educational quality and opportunities per student.  I don\'t think Yale would be on that list, however - it has small classes and fantastic undergraduate outcomes.  \n\nI think I brought up the Nobel prizes thing mostly to counter OP\'s claim that ""Yale has many weak departments.""  It actually doesn\'t have any weak departments, not in terms of undergrad experience and not in terms of graduate school/research.  \n\n(ps - I have no affilation with Yale, just trying to be real)', 'Right, Rhodes scholarships are a bad example (although I\'ll note that Yale and Princeton will enjoy similar advantages). Also, Brown is associated with 7 Nobel prizes, not 4. Just felt obligated to defend Brown and Dartmouth by trying to make a distinction between the quality of the undergraduate college and the quality of their research programs (I see people on here getting confused by the QS world rankings all the time).\n\nAfter all, this is a subreddit for applying to undergraduate programs, so that\'s the context in which I interpreted the question. As you said, Nobel prizes serve as a proxy for historical significance and research output significantly more than undergrad education. In my view, it would be hard to argue that Princeton is ""overrated"" simply because it doesn\'t have as many Nobel prizes as Berkeley.', ""You may not be aware of this, but for decades, Rhodes scholarships have been allocated in part on a state by state basis.  Columbia has to compete with Cornell and all the other universities in New York State (which also explains why Cornell has fewer), whereas Brown really has to compete only with URI.  Darthmouth has a similar advantage.\n\nIf you look at the list by school, the University of Montana, the University of Oklahoma, the University of Kansas, Sewannee, and the University of Mississippi each have more Rhodes Scholars than UC Berkeley,  UPenn, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, etc.  Colleges in California, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois and New York have a ton more competition.\n\nBut to be clear, I wasn't trying to knock Brown either."", 'Probably Dartmouth, it‚Äôs barely talked about it on this sub and I don‚Äôt know anything about it other than the mascot is a keg', 'It‚Äôs memes for being the easy ivy and it half of it is public.', 'I think Cornell has the strongest stem program out of the Ivy League and Dyson is super competitive as well.\n\nI think the only way it‚Äôs under hyped is people consider it as the ‚Äúeasy Ivy‚Äù', 'Only on this forum not to the general public', 'Cornell is hyped a lot']"

Some programs may convey especially transferrable credentials (for example, an international nursing degree) that are more globally-accepted than what you might get from a traditional program in the US.  Others may be completely useless outside of the issuing country.  \n\nAnd for extra clarification/confirmation:\n\n* **US-partnered dual-degree programs and joint-venture universities** are a great place to look if you're worried about degree recognition.

At brown, every professor is required to teach. Additionally, the vast majority of student course reviews for brown all seem to emphasize that the professor explained concepts well, was easy to contact outside of class, and was funny/likable. Additionally, at Brown, any student at any level can email nearly any professor asking for research opportunities, and they are almost guaranteed to be brought into the professor‚Äôs research group. Even as a freshman you can participate in meaningful research.\n\nOther schools may have way more nobel laureates on the faculty, but the majority of these people only focus on research and don‚Äôt teach. Additionally, being smart and accomplished does not necessarily make you a good teacher. Research opportunities at other schools are usually way more competitive, and as a freshman you are unlikely to participate in anything meaningful (this varies by college, I‚Äôm not trying to throw a blanket statement over every school here, but it‚Äôs not uncommon).

You'll be going in-depth in your particular area, with less time or expectation that you'll study in other areas.  You may have a cognate or two, where you explore some of the interdisciplinary connections between your field and others, but unlike undergrad they are less likely to require you distribute your credits around a variety of study fields.\n\nYou are more like to work with faculty closely and develop a mentoring relationship.\n\nSocial life can still be great.  You're less likely to be doing the greek life thing but you can get into all the bars if you like that scene.  It will vary with your cohort and the culture of your department."", 'Thank you for the thoughtful response, that actually helps clear a lot of the misconceptions I had, very insightful thank you!', 'I‚Äôll be referring to the top 10 cs schools (Michigan onward) within the context of the response. So if I say ‚Äúall‚Äù think top 10-20, because i cant give a specific answer that covers every range.\n\nFrom an academic standpoint, one thing is it that within t10 it matters very little where you go for undergrad. T20 it still basically doesnt matter. Why? Because the undergrad curriculum and what kids are capable of learning in a 4 year timeframe doesnt come close to actually revealing the hyperspecific strengths and weaknesses of a research school. Your undergrad education at Michigan will see largely no differences between CMU or MIT. The way the courses are taught will change somewhat variably yes, but you wont see classes at CMU that you wont find anywhere else. \n\nSo why go to a CMU MIT or Stanford or some other tippy top cs school for undergrad?\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to necessarily,\n\nHOWEVER\n\nYou asked for differences in grad school, and thats where school specifics come in. CMU will have a better robotics department than Stanford, and UW will be better than both in NLP and so stanford better in something else and so on. Depending on what subfields and professor (professor does matter) you want to work under in grad school, nothing will be consistent across schools. The t10s are much more diverse in their subfields, which is what is important in grad school. \n\nAnd these profs, subfields, etc, will be open to you at undergrad if you go to one of these school and try to meet people. Going to undergrad at one school gives you some of their resources a bit earlier (depends on school, some give less some give more). And some schools like UW only offer masters degrees to current cse undergrads.\n\nTldr: speaking about academics, grad school is more specialized for subfields and research topics, while undergrad is generally homogenous across similar tiers of schools. If price is an issue, you should go to schools that are slightly cheaper for undergrad, as grad school is where school choice makes the big difference, but going to certain schools does provide you some level of headstart in that school‚Äôs top subfields.

You can learn to be good at almost anything.  Case in point - a good friend of mine was in remedial math classes in 7th grade and a lot of people wrote him off.  He is now a professor in STEM at an Ivy.  Obviously his math ability was at one point below the ""normal"" level even for a mediocre public school.  Now, he\'s one of the top scientists in his field (and quite good at math).  \n\nI think getting better at stuff requires hard work and practice.  You don\'t learn how to express yourself or write an outstanding essay by sitting down for one Saturday afternoon and ""manifesting"" it or trying to bootstrap yourself.  You get there with practice, coaching, hard work, practice, effort, repetition, practice, etc.  \n\nSo the short answer is yes, it\'s possible, but it\'s really a long shot for some people.  I\'ve had people come to me in December and ask me to coach them into a top essay by January 1.  Some of them make it, but most people have a pretty defined ceiling at that point and there\'s just not enough time to break through it.  I\'ve had some people who were just awful writers and there wasn\'t enough time or buy-in from them to ever have a chance.  But most students I work with improve dramatically.\n\nThe level of improvement also depends a bit on where you\'re starting.  Just like with physical fitness, the gains from some really focused efforts are highest for people who start out the lowest.  Olympic lifters aren\'t going to see much by way of gains no matter how hard they work because they\'re already the best in the world.  But a total couch potato might increase his max lift by 50% in just 6 weeks.  That said, I\'ve seen some students go from **really** bad to quite good (e.g. one student last cycle had a first draft about how he was like Batman.  It was awful, disjointed, broken, and honestly among the bottom 100 or so essays I\'ve ever read.  After a TON of work, he got into Columbia as an international requesting full aid.)\n\nBottom line - it\'s going to take a lot of work and research.  You\'re going to have to invest a lot into it.

Taxes should be proportional to the amount of wealth you have, since that is only logical. Also, over taxing the working class never works for the economy and society, and history shows that (hello France.) Also, taxing based on wealth is not a socialist policy at all. In fact people like Bernie are not socialists but social democrats, essentially progressives or the current left wing parties in European countries.\n\nI also think that to get as rich as Bezos, you can't be generous and compassionate.

But a $4 Million home is going to be pretty damned nice, and you don\'t just buy one of those by accident.  \n\nRich tax-avoidance solution: create a non-profit trust company off shore to hold the title of your home, and pay a service fee or rent to the non-profit in exchange for the use of the property.  Rich guy doesn\'t ""own"" the house, he just controls the entity that ""owns"" it.  \n\nNow that\'s not a perfect example, because there are some federal laws here that control non-US entities from owning US properly without disclosures &amp; approvals, but it\'s a simple story that paints an accurate-enough picture of the problems involved.  \n\nSo...  \n\nWhere does the money come from?', 'No I don‚Äôt think we should take from the rich to solve our problems.

If you want to use the Barron's book, I would recommend watching the Crash Course chem videos over the summer before cracking open the book.\n\nEven after honors chem in 1st semester, I didn't use the book much because I had my school-issued AP chem textbook, which I used instead.

I can remember that the book was somewhat useful from the few times I flipped through it during my time in AP chem.\n\n**TL;DR** You'll have to initially familiarize yourself with the material on your own, since the book assumes you already know some chemistry, but if you can do that, it's not a terrible idea."", 'Pre-AP courses typically don‚Äôt cover the same topics as a regular AP course.

What i think will happen is that they will continue to go along with their ideas of resuming the SAT, whether it be taking it online or in testing centers. They will do this because they know that many students will have to take the SAT, not because they want to, but because they need to so that the rising senior of this year can apply to the colleges that requires SAT scores. Yea sure, colleges will have to extend deadlines for students to submit SAT scores, but if by the time the SAT comes out (August) and we are still stuck in quarantine or if going outside is still dangerous, the only possible way we can take the SAT before it is too late would be at home because testing centers will be filled. If CB decided to cancel At-Home SAT, it will be a complete mess for students and colleges that requires SAT because the lack of testing centers for students already means that not everyone will be able to take the test and taking away the option of At-Home SAT would generate more opposition and criticism towards CB from students who will say that there wasn't enough opportunity and from colleges that are still saying that SAT score are required for admission and that CB is not giving all students the opportunity to take the test. Eventually, the criticism CB will receive from students will cause them to resume the online SAT anyways but probably later than planned.\n\nIf they do give online SATs, which, in my opinion, they mostly likely will, we still don't know about the format it will be in. The AP exams, for example, had different versions of them          -some were harder while other ones were easier. Who knows what they will do...

It is also fair to say that people here tend to have a competitive streak, which encourages constant underrepresentation of preparation. I agree with both points.\n\nHowever, I do think they should stay away. I think one should have a rough idea of what to prepare for and when (10th grade start checking out SAT, subjects, 11th grade colleges, 11th grade summer applications), then focus on things in themselves. A constant reminder of college admissions only adds undue stress on many people and causes many to focus on doing things for appearances- which is common enough without encouragement. It prevents self-discovery and personal development, which ultimately hinders one\'s growth. \n\nI will also disagree with you about help is help regardless of intent. In my experience, lasting or significant change very rarely occur without long-term commitment and serious thinking- both of which are rarely present in high school student initiatives. Especially when the students are motivated by CV prospects. You wouldn\'t believe how much dishonesty this breeds- the wast resources of the privileged to lie and trick perpetuates injustice. Many well intending students also lose their moral compass in panic (which this subreddit greatly amplifies) and become tools to faux displays of goodwill.  If, instead of obsessing over colleges, they had spent time in their community, observing problems and thinking solutions, getting together with friends, spending their time with their values in mind, they would create more effective, longer lasting change. Besides, people who would pay others to fake research/social service/etc. and waste their own time would not be rewarded as much. However, this is game theory. In the prisoner\'s dilemma, when you know the other one will lie, you are also incentivized to lie. I failed to find a way out of this system. But it sure doesn\'t need more obsession with admissions.\n\nAnd I come to what I think should be said to younger students: The advantage of learning/doing/knowing early is limited. By always looking into the future, you are missing out on many things going around you right now. Find a basic timeline for preparation (if you don\'t have access to information in your school, you can ask niche questions here) and follow it.

This can result in deteriorating mental health, as they are constantly comparing themselves to others and in general needlessly stressing themselves out, when they should just be enjoying their last year of middle school or their respective year."", ""I'm entitled because I don't think someone else is entitled to make decisions for other people? I'm not saying their opinion can't be shared, I just think that on a subreddit that is made for helping students with college applications and admissions, that should come first. If someone asks for help and they are an underclass, I believe they should be given help and not told how they shouldn't be worrying about XYZ."", ""There's an objective disconnect between a fruitful consumption of college admissions content and the content on this subreddit. Students who obsess over college admission often fail to see the value of college and experience major mental and even physical health tolls. Browsing this subreddit or consuming any external sources of opinionated college admissions content is not a prerequisite to get into a good college. There is absolutely no reason anyone that is not a junior should be avidly browsing and posting on this subreddit unless there is a real, tangible issue that would benefit from the experience of others students and/or their opinions. Fussing over rankings and applicant profiles here and on r/chanceme achieves absolutely nothing and is, in fact, bad.\n\nThe majority of the students who are on these types of forums are private school students who already live the frankly shit-filled uber competitive college admissions life. There's no need to be exposed to that. It sucks and is not healthy. They have nothing to offer and can be spotted at a top college like a sore thumb. If anyone has their high school in their instagram bio stay away from them. \n\nFurther, college is statistically not an objective measure of success. There is no need to waste 5 years of life, focus, and mental effort on admissions. It is not hard to get into a top 50 college in the United States if you are of at least average intelligence and are in at least average conditions.

I majored in Botany and I had great plans to go on for a masters in golf course management but everything changed when I moved to Hawaii and I realized I would never move up in the ranks, despite a higher education, unless someone retired or literally died. I was fucking crushed when I discovered the reality of the situation. I then started my own lawn care business and found out I had a knack for sales because I fucking killed it. Not just because of my superior service but because I could convince the richest douchebags to fire their 5 man crew and hire me, just one guy, for almost twice the price. Then I threw my back out multiple times, ended up unable to work with no health insurance to help me heal. One of my customer‚Äôs roommates was a licensed osteopath who also specialized in Rossitter Stretching. Not a single therapist had ever been able to help me until I met him. I went back to work immediately and felt like a teenager again. I eventually left Hawaii after selling my lawn care business and decided to go full force into sales. I was worried about getting a job because I smoked tons of weed and I turned down every job offer that had any resemblance to botany when they told me WeEd iS eViL until.....I finally figured out that sales professionals don‚Äôt give a fuck as long as you hit your numbers. \n\nI worked with crazy coke heads and raging alcoholics. I fucking killed it. It just fit my personality. College didn‚Äôt teach me that. College never taught me anything besides how to sell drugs, tap a keg, run from cops, blow up rental properties with grow ops to fund my education, and how to lie to my parents about how I could afford to spend multiple weeks in Vegas. \n\nNow, had college been free, ironically, I never would have gone. It wouldn‚Äôt have held the same prestige of ‚Äúpaying your own way‚Äù as say a trade school or simply getting a job, IMHO. \n\nThe fact it‚Äôs NOT free is encouragement for people to do it because it‚Äôs not free. An expensive education certainly sways employers too. It literally holds a make-believe hierarchy in this country, or any other that doesn‚Äôt guarantee free education. \n\nLook at really expensive schools, like Harvard, for example. Sure they have great teachers but at what cost?  Who‚Äôs to say I can‚Äôt learn the same things through Khan Academy, for free?  \n\nI literally made a bad investment even though I technically paid it off, but what was the cost? I could have dumped that money into my local economy. I could have been making money and paying taxes (student loan interest is tax deductible). Almost everything I paid went to both, bloated college administrations and predatory lending organizations. I could have trained for any number of jobs while stimulating the economy instead of trying to figure out to enrich the former and latter\n\nAlso, I have no problem paying a few buck more in taxes if it means I can live next to intelligent people with an education as opposed to my last redneck, asshole neighbors who constantly bragged about not finishing high school and dealing with them blowing shit up every weekend because they thought it was funny. Shocker!

Nah I am also awake at 5 but yeah it definitely a challenge to put these things into perspective after being in such a competitive school environment for what seems like a long/formative part of our lives. I will say that I think the things that do make you happy might be more productive but it is definitely a struggle to find a healthy balance between the things that make you happy and your responsibilities/ambitions in college/career.\n\n Its so easy to be consumed by college and I am by no means in the clear as I still get these feelings from time to time.

Graduating with ""Honors"" was not special and several people got into Ivies and other prestigious schools like UPenn, Brown, Cornell, etc...\n\nI graduated with honors and did the APs and the whole thing but I ended up community college because I couldn\'t crack the top 10% at my school to even get accepted at even 1 UC. (4.1 Weighted gpa and 1270 SAT - pretty low at my school and on this sub). \n\nIts easy to feel incompetent when surrounded by all these amazing people and it feels worse with the hate as well. I do believe we believe are more than the name of school we go to but I know its hard to get out of that mindset. Even I struggle with it right now 2 years after graduation and accepted to transfer to the UCs I got rejected from. \n\nIn my experience, you are always going to feel that you could\'ve done more. I\'ve always struggled with high school and felt mentally exhausted but sometimes just waking up and going to school was the best I could do that day. And I think its important to give yourself a break and just try to be happy (even though it can be hard).\n\nI wanted to study more but I didn\'t and chose to play or watch or whatever I wasted my time with. And when I realized if I ran it back 4  years, I would probably do the same exact thing. I realized the time I wasted reading and learning useless shit made me happy. As much as I wanted that admiration and prestige to my name, it wasn\'t me. As much as I value education, that lifestyle wasn\'t good or important to me as a person. And I will always feel jealous of other people but at the end of the day you will be known for your accomplishments and how you are as a person. You have the next four years at a great university to work on those accomplishments and it won\'t matter if you accomplish anything in the next 4 years or 40 years. Its okay to regret not having done more so do your best now and make the most out of the hand you were dealt.\n\n Sorry for the long post I just really relate to these feeling of wanting to do more and I would hate for others to feel to same.

Small classes, tight connections with profs and students. It‚Äôs only a two year program and graduate with same degrees as other NYU students and at the same time. \n- NYU LSP funnels to grad school really well assuming you want to go that route because of grade inflation. \n- You might get to study abroad too during your first year assuming you got into one of their global sites. Experience a different culture learn a new language, may be useful for sociology?\n- Since you‚Äôre getting your core requirements out of the way early, you have more time to switch majors in the humanities/ social sciences. \n\nCons: \n- It‚Äôs definitely not worth it if cost is too high. You‚Äôre gonna get a great education at UW anyways and quality of education for sociology is essentially the same at both schools. Going to NYU for the name and prestige is HIGHLY overrated. \n- If you want to switch to more stem based fields, the core classes you‚Äôre taking aren‚Äôt really related at all, and you‚Äôll waste time. \n- You have to take a few more core classes that are humanities based, so lots of reading and writing (I guess this can tie to sociology) and less space for electives you want to take. If you‚Äôre not interested in doing that, don‚Äôt recommend. \n- It could be harder to double major \n\nGl making you‚Äôre decision :-)', ""Most of that tuition is just based on NYU's location in NYC.

They review your application independently, meaning it is possible to get accepted to one but not the other. You might be required to submit an additional essay of why you want to do JD/MBA. \n* For MBA admissions, they extend an interview if they like your profile. You cannot get admitted without an interview. But just because you receive an interview does not mean you will be accepted. For law school admissions, some schools have interviews, some do not. Again, most law school admissions is determined by your GPA + LSAT.\n* A required MBA essay in some format is a variation of ""Why MBA and why now?"" So I wouldn\'t be thinking necessarily about applying to whatever school that you think will accept you. This will require careful introspection of your own career path and what you want to do. If this is not articulated, even if you have great stats, you will be rejected.\n\nAs to the second aspect of your question re: intersection, if your ultimate goal is simply corporate law, an MBA is not required. Most attorneys, including partners, do not have this degree. As stated before, there are some areas where it could be useful. But general transactional law at a big law firm is probably not the answer for that.', ""As for extracurriculars, there aren't any that can fully capture the essence of what to expect in law school and/or what it means to practice in law. But there are many students who were involved with mock trial, Model, UN, debate, College Democrats/Republicans, etc. The pre-law society on your campus may put together events where they bring practicing attorneys to campus to speak about their experiences. But again, fairly superficial. I didn't participate in any of the aforementioned activities but don't think it put me at any disadvantage for law school\n\nI think the best way to get a sense of what to expect is to do the following:\n\n* Seek out coffee chats with current law school students and talk about their lives. This is where developing that network in undergrad is important because it becomes easier to reach out to a friend then a stranger on LinkedIn or through school club directories\n* Seek internships with legal organizations. 99.99% of the time, it will be unpaid so you might need to take advantage of school programs that provide funding for these types of internships (and/or rely on your parents to help support if that is available). While you won't be able to do meaningful legal work, you can see first-hand what the job looks like on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis\n* If you are thinking of doing corporate law, you can look to be a paralegal at law firms for a couple of years. This will help solidify what it means to be a transactional lawyer, what the hour expectations are, etc."", 'What was the application and interview process like for a JD-MBA?

In the 2nd year Math Applications is added.\n\nIn the 1st year we also take History, geography and philosophy along the subjects mentioned above for all departments and in the second year you can continue them and drop the science subjects if you are in the humanities department.\n\nThe system needs a ton of work tbh, I kinda wish we also werent brainwashed into thinking that getting a good degree in the final year is all that matters and you will be able to enter whatever you want and be whatever you want. Because in reality the system sucks you can't really switch majors and you need to pick which field (humanities or scientific) you want to be in right after 10th grade which is insane if you ask me.\n\nEdit: just remembered class ranks are mostly removed I believe never saw any place that reports them, never saw a perfect 100% score like the old system as well though that could exist. I wonder how will they grade me if I apply, I doubt many people apply to top universities in the US from Egypt, the ones I see are always post graduate"", 'Your entire 4 year GPA is based on standardized testing?

US universities, on the other hand, consider anything above 90% an A, so they don't care as much.\n\nThat said, they _will_ take a look at it, and you can assume that they'll at least have a general idea of how it translates. You're gonna want a GPA around 4.0 if you're international.

I think the issue truly is that free reviewers (and good ones especially) are simply overburdened with SO many essays that they cannot help but abridge their comments in order to get to everyone. On the other hand, like many things in the college admissions process (unfortunately), money will make things better/easier by paid reviewers having less clients (due to requiring a fee) and thereby producing better reviews (i.e. more in-depth)."", 'I see, hmm I guess I was under the wrong impression what consulting meant. I didn‚Äôt realize they actually directed the content of your work. I thought it was pointing out awkward sentences, avoiding repetition, maybe avoiding clich√©s or something of that nature.\n\nI‚Äôll see if consulting services are manageable for me. Do you think scholargrade‚Äôs feedback was consequential to your essay and getting into your university?', 'The argument of ""is it worth it"" for paid reviewers/paid services (companies) is a separate one from the one I\'d like to discuss in this post. In fact, I would agree with you that I do not believe paying for review services is, in general, ""worth"" it.\n\nMore than anything, I think essay review is a resource individuals use to assuage their own anxieties about their essay. It should not be used as a ""help-me-write-an-essay"" tool, but rather a ""tell-me-what-you-think"" one. To that end, it is my mistake to not detail in my post that more than anything, I think essay review is about reviewing the presentation of the applicant in the essay. Therefore, I wasn\'t really thinking about details like grammar, spelling, syntax, etc., as that is something I would recommend going over by oneself or with a English teacher.\n\nI also agree that feedback, no matter how ""professional,"" should be taken with a grain of salt!', ""In the context of the subreddit, I didn't know that it was against the rules, and that's my bad.\n\nHowever, that is not what I am addressing with my post -- more than anything, I simply wanted to present an argument for individuals who do (outside of the subreddit) charge money for essay review.\n\nI haven't seen u/Scholargrade's posts, but I'll give them a look! I disagree with the notion that there is not value to recent admit advice, however (and the claim that it is potentially harmful); first, I do not believe that having a second pair of eyes looking at a draft could produce anything but assistance. As I stated in my post, suggestions during essay review are merely that: *suggestions.* Having additional input has always helped me, even if I did not agree with said input.\n\nIn terms of grammar/syntax review, I agree! I've never trusted others in general with grammar/syntax review, not because I do not trust them as editors though, but because I believe that's something that is the original writer's responsibility to comb through relentlessly. That may be another point of contention with others on this subreddit, but for me at least, an essay review for college admissions specifically focuses on getting critiques for the essay's ideas and presentation of the applicant to others. In my opinion, anyone is sufficiently qualified to comment on their impressions of another from a ~650 word essay."", ""I think the big assumption that you make, and expect us to agree with (and you mention at the start of your post) is a bit flawed. It appears to be as simple as breaking it down to--- got into college = must have had a good essay (or good understanding of what a good essay is)\n\nThis isn't always the case. There are many other factors that can go into getting into college. You mean to tell me the rich students who get in on account of making the college a few hundred thousand and nothing else are really just as qualified as the top applicants that have amazing essays? No way. Being admitted is not a sign of expertise in any particular subject, it just means there was some reason (or mix of reasons) that the AOs at that particular college had to admit you, and those reasons could have absolutely nothing to do with your essay."", '&gt; Dropping $100 for a common app read or even more for supplements for a dozen schools is wilddd.\n\nIt\'s ridiculous to low income kids. Rich kids won\'t blink an eye. \n\n&gt; there are plenty available people who are willing to do it for free on this sub.\n\nAgain, unless you strike gold, the quality is just not going to be comparable. It may be helpful but not to the extent that paid reviews are.\n\n&gt; I think just having a conversation to walk through your ideas is pretty nice. Or having people point out your grammatical errors and weak sentences is especially useful.\n\nYes, this helps, but it\'s a lot different to have detailed feedback saying ""here\'s what you\'re missing in terms of ideas, big picture, and here\'s EXACTLY how to fix that.""\n\n&gt; I‚Äôm not sure how other schools do it but we have a dedicated week for English teachers to give feedback on college essays for seniors. Maybe they can‚Äôt tell you what an AO wants to hear, but they can spot out common clich√©s, bad grammar etc. However this is an amazing privilege we have that other schools might not offer\n\nYeah, but that gets your essay from bad to mediocre. It won\'t get your essay from meh to great.\n\n&gt; What type of feedback did Scholargrade give?\n\nI chatted you but basically he wrote a paragraph of feedback for EVERY paragraph I wrote (oftentimes longer than my paragraph) and gave two rounds of that feedback, and also offered to answer any other miscellaneous questions I had about my essay.', 'I appreciate your insight! \n\nCollege consulting services are traditionally expensive though. Dropping $100 for a common app read or even more for supplements for a dozen schools is wilddd.

If you choose not to network with them than that\'s your choice. It\'s similar to how people choose to get involved in organizations and clubs and sororities.
